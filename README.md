# 🌍 SDG 13: Climate Action – CO2 Emissions Forecasting

This project supports **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13** by using machine learning to forecast CO2 emissions using historical data.

## ✅ Problem Statement
Predict carbon emissions trends to inform policies aimed at reducing climate change impact.

## 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Approach**: Supervised Learning
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- Evaluated using R², MAE, RMSE
- Visualized emissions trend and predictions

## 🧠 Ethics
- Transparency: Code is open.
- Fairness: Based on reliable climate metrics.
- Limitation: Uses synthetic data for demo.

## 💻 How to Run
