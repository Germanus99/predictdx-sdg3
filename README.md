# SDG 13: Climate Action – CO2 Emissions Forecasting 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can support **UN SDG 13: Climate Action** by predicting future **CO2 emissions** based on historical data using a **Linear Regression** model.

## 🎯 Goal
To build a supervised learning model that forecasts CO2 emissions, helping governments and organizations make data-informed decisions for climate policy.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 ML Approach
- **Type**: Supervised Learning
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Metrics**: R² Score, MAE, RMSE

## 🧠 Ethical Reflection
- ⚖️ Fairness: Ensured dataset is not biased.
- 🌱 Sustainability: Encourages proactive carbon reduction.
